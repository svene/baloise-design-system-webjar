= Ideas:


= curl and maven:

- use curl to recursively download design system files from jsdelivery
  wget --no-parent -r https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@baloise/ds-core@16.1.0/dist/
- create a webjar from the downloaded files and put it to nexus

=> download takes very long since it is a lot of files -> does not feel right

= npm install and maven:

- use npm install with a package.json including the design system
- use a pom.xml including a webjar plugin for packaging the node_modules folder

== Build

- npm install
